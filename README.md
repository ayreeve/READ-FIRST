# READ FIRST

Hello! Have a look at info provided below for better orientation on this page (and, who knows, maybe some value, _secret_ information...).

Welcome to my GH profile. You can find some of my recent projects here. I have divided content in “Repositories” tab into three sections, for better readability and clarity (and also because I care about UX). 

1. In section one (numbers from 1 to 3), you can find websites (mostly designed and coded by myself; one of them is inspired by PSD template). The details are important to me, so on some pages I also designed logos and created a textual content (if you like animals and Orwell you may like the Entire website too –  but don’t rush with scrolling down). I’ve used: HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, RWD, Grunt, Git and a pinch sense of humor.

2. In section two (no. 4-8) I placed pure JS/jQuery projects. Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, RWD, pure JS, jQuery, Ajax, API Grunt, Git and abuse “Why?!” question.

3. And finally, last section (9-13) contains a few JS training projects (which isn’t and won’t be styled).

At the top of each subpage, I’ve added link to the live version. If you are curious and inquisitive visitor (or you like to read stupid things), you are the reason why I’ve provided more extensive descriptions (at the bottom). It is also a place where a visual multi-device preview is contained.
